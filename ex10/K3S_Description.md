# K3S

## 1. What is it?
**K3S** is a lightweight, simplified version of Kubernetes designed to be resource-efficient and easier to deploy. It is optimized for environments with limited resources, such as IoT devices, edge computing, and small server setups.

## 2. When should it be used?
K3S should be used when you need a Kubernetes solution but have limited resources (e.g., low-memory systems or ARM devices). It is also ideal for edge computing, IoT projects, or when you need a simpler, faster way to deploy Kubernetes in smaller environments.

## 3. Where can it be used?
K3S can be used on devices with limited resources, such as:
- Raspberry Pi and other ARM-based devices
- Edge computing environments
- IoT devices
- Development environments that need a lightweight Kubernetes setup for testing or small-scale projects

## 4. Why should I use it?
You should use K3S because it is lightweight and consumes less resources compared to full Kubernetes. It simplifies deployment and management, making it ideal for small systems or edge applications. It offers most of the features of Kubernetes while being easier to set up and run on systems with less power.
